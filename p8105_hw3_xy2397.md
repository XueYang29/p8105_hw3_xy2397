Problem 1
=========

**Load the data**

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
```

**Read and clean the data**

• format the data to use appropriate variable names; • focus on the “Overall Health” topic • include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” • organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
brfss = 
  
  # read the data "brfss_smart2010" from the p8105.datasets package
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  
  # clean up variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # filter the data to only focus on "Overall Health" topic
  filter(., topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  
  # include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
  select(., year, locationabbr, locationdesc, response, data_value) %>%
  
  # mutate responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”
  mutate(., response = as.factor(response))
```
